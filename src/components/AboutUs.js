      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Sunset Travel Agency was founded in 1995 by John and Jane Doe, a husband
        and wife team who had a passion for travel and helping others explore
        the world. They started the company in their small apartment, offering
        personalized travel planning services to a small group of clients. As
        the company grew, Sunset Travel Agency became known as the go-to
        destination for travelers seeking personalized, immersive travel
        experiences. Today, the agency remains a trusted partner for travelers
        seeking unforgettable travel experiences, and a leader in the travel
        industry.
